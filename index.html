              <h3>Underfloor Heating Repairs</h3>
              <p>
                Thermaze offers a repair service to customers who are having Wet or
                Electric underfloor heating problems or have had a bad experience
                and the installer has washed their hands of it and won't come back.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will come to your property, take an impartial look at the system
                and listen to your experiences to get the system back up to full
                working speed in no time!
              </p>
              <p>
                The most common problems we find are wiring issues, zones not
                heating up, air locked pipes, worn out pumps and these are all
                issues that can be easily sorted out.
              </p>
              <p>
                One phrase we hear very often is “but what if the problem is under
                the floor?” and we want to reassure you that in 99% of cases the
                problem with your underfloor heating system is normally above
                ground!

                Sergiu came to assess problems I was having with my underfloor
                thermostatic control. He explained what was going wrong with the
                system... and then fixed it! He fitted five Nest smart termostats
                in a day and gave fabulous service: reliable, knowledgable,
                efficient and extremely skillful.

                Sergiu was really clear describing the problem (ufh system not
                functioning) and set out the options (and what they would cost)
                really clearly. The work was done promptly and successfully, I'd
                definitely use Thermaze again but I think it's all fixed now so I

                We had underfloor heating installed throughout our whole house,
                Sergiu and his team were great and would highly recommend them. We
                really liked Sergiu's relaxed approach and was more than happy to
                answer all of our questions and any concerns we had.

                This company is excellent and have just done a total repair of our
                underfloor heating which hasn't worked properly for years! They
                were really knowledgeable, polite and efficient. It is working so
                beautifully and we are warm again! Thank you for a great job.

                Sergiu and his team are very polite and professional. The engineer
                was able to quickly identify the source of my underfloor heating
                problem and fixed it in no time. They clearly knew what they were
                doing! Highly recommend them.

                Excellent service by Sergiu. Came out and inspected the UFH pipe
                work using his thermal scanner. Identified some cold spots but on
                inspection of the manifold, noticed the actuator valves were
                sticking and faulty. He ordered better brands and came back
                following day to fit. All working properly and finally got heat
                back into the areas that were cold. Definitely recommend

                I have had great trouble finding wet-underfloor heating experts
                and, having unsuccessfully used a few others, am truly delighted
                to have met Thermaze. They came quickly to assess the problem.
                They then proposed a solution, returned and solved the issue and
                performed a full service, all completed on budget. Andrew the
                engineer was excellent and explained everything he was doing as he
                went along. I highly recommend Thermaze.

                Our heating system had broken and had never worked very well.
                Sergiu came and fixed the system and then worked some magic so
                that it now works as we had always hoped it would. Great job!

                New UFH system had some issues, needed balancing. Working great

                I had a new underfloor heating system installed 6 months back
                never got the temperature above 22-23 degrees. So found Thermeze
                online and called though not sure what to expect. Sergiu not only
                identified the issue with wiring but also fixed it in an hour. Now
                I can feel the underfloor heating finally working. I would
                definitely recommend Sergiu and his services.

                underfloor heating system. Highly recommended.
